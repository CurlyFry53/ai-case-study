## Recommendations

It would benefit the company because there are a lot of visual learners and they would appreciate the video clip of the important meeting details. Also, I have not seen any other company doing this very well/at all.

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?

Technology that it could use to create this service would be to use their summary feature to find clips that mention important concepts/parts of the meetings. 

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?

These would be appropriate for the solution because it will provide the user with the video clips that provide the most important information while not adding too much overhead.
